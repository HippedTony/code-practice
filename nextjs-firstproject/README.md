This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project was created following a Next.js 13 tutorial aimed at building a complete application from start to finish.

The goal was to practice and understand key features of the framework, including:
- React Server Components (RSC)
- The App Router (`app` directory)
- File-based routing
- Data fetching using `fetch`
- Styling the application (Bootstrap)
- Deploying the project for free on Vercel
