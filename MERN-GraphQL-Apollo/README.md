# MERN-GraphQL-Apollo

## 📖 Description

I built a project management admin application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js).

The application uses GraphQL with Apollo for backend and frontend communication, allowing the execution of queries and mutations through a GraphQL API connected to MongoDB with relational data queries.
