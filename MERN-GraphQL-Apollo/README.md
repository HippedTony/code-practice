# MERN-GraphQL-Apollo

## 📖 Description

I built a project management admin application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js).

The application uses GraphQL with Apollo for backend and frontend communication, allowing the execution of queries and mutations through a GraphQL API connected to MongoDB with relational data queries.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

This project requires two terminal windows: one for the server and one for the client.
It also requires a running MongoDB database.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- MongoDB (running locally)

### Steps

1. Make sure MongoDB is running locally.
   ```bash
   mongod

2. In the root directory, start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev

3. Open a second terminal, navigate to the client folder, and start the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev

The backend GraphQL server will be available by default at:
  ```bash
  http://localhost:4000/graphql
